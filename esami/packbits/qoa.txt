ho slice di 64 bit -> decode -> 20 sample of 16 bit(?)

sample = 3.2 bit of storage space

qoa file = 8Byte file_header + num Frame 
at least 1 FRAME;

FRAME = 
- at least one channel;
- at least one sample with sample rate fc = [1:16777215]
	- 8Byte frame_header 
	- 16B enc_dec state
	- 256 slice (da 8byte?


x each channel:

- last frame can contain < 256 slices-> [1:256]
- the other must contain 256!
- last slice in last frame:
	- can be < 20 sample (64 bit/6Byte)
	- 8 bytes wides 
		-> unused bytes = 0;
